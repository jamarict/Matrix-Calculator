# Matrix-Calculator
This matrix calculator functions entirely in Python and makes use of the list data type to create matrices and vectors.
The calculator uses object-oriented programming to specify all of the matrix and vector properties that are commonly associated with each (transposes, inverses, onto, 1-1, norm, projections, etc...)

There is currently an unfinished portion that implements all of the code into a graphical interface using CMU Graphics. This interface will only rely on keys, mouses presses, and background matrices knowledge to use.
